# SQL-challenge
Week 9 HW SQL


It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.
In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:

Data Engineering/Data Modeling\
Data Analysis

#### Process:
For this assignment I had to inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. (posted above) \
I then used this information to create a table schema for each of the CSV files. These were impored into a corresponding SQL Table. \
This database was then used for some basic analysis both in SQL and Python.
